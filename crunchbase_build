# You can make an interesting observation here, when you run the program. We have no record limits specified here,
# however after a set of records the loop ends. It's interesting, this is one of the advantage versus say
# running a SQL query against a data-base that has all these records and you forget to limit the Where clause.


#You have made a start by connecting to the API and printing response from it. 
#I will develop this code to have more additional features
